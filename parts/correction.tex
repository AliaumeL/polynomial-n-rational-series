\subsection{The Corrected Theorem}
\label{sec:proof}

The counter example provided by \cref{def:bad-polynomial} relies on the fact
that $\CoveredPoly$ is not stable under fixing indeterminates, while
\kl{$\Nat$-polyregular functions} are. In this section, we prove that closing
$\CorrectPoly$ under assignments of variable is enough to recover from
\cref{karh:thm}.

\AP We use the following notation to fix the value of some indeterminate, if
$P(X,Y)$ is a polynomial in $\Rel[X,Y]$, then $\intro*\restr{P(X,Y)}{X = 1}$ is
the polynomial $P(1,Y) \in \Rel[Y]$. More generally, if $\nu$ is a partial
function from $\vec{X}$ to $\Nat$, written $\nu \colon \vec{X} \topartial
\Nat$, the restriction $\restr{P(\vec{X})}{\nu}$ is the polynomial with
indeterminates $\vec{Y} \defined \vec{X} - \dom(\nu)$ obtained by fixing the
variables of the domain of $\nu$.


\begin{definition}
    Let $\vec{X}$ be a finite tuple of indeterminates.
    The class $\intro*\CorrectPoly[\vec{X}]$ is the collection of
    polynomials $P \in \Rel[\vec{X}]$ such that
    $P$ is 
    such that, for every partial function $\nu \colon \vec{X} \topartial \Nat$,
    every \kl{maximal monomial} of
    $\restr{P}{\nu}$ is \kl{non-negative}.
\end{definition}

First, let us remark that $\CorrectPoly \subseteq \CoveredPoly$, because
polynomials in $\CorrectPoly$ are \kl{non-negative}. Let us also check that the
counter example provided in \cref{thm:counter-example} is not in
$\CorrectPoly$. For that, notice that for $\BadPoly$ introduced in
\cref{def:bad-polynomial}, $\BadPoly(X,Y,1) = 3X^2 + 3Y^2 - 2XY$, which has a negative
coefficient for a \kl{maximal monomial}, namely $-2XY$. 

Let us now prove that \kl{$\Nat$-rational polynomials} are in $\CorrectPoly$.
This follows from the correct implication in the statement of \cref{karh:thm},
but we provide a self-contained proof using a refinement of the
classical combinatorial arguments for $\ZPoly$ \cite[Lemma 4.16]{CDTL23} and
$\NPoly$ \cite[Lemma 5.37]{DOUE23}.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{n-poly-combinatorics:lem}
    Let $f$ be a  \kl{$\Nat$-polyregular} function. 
    There exists a computable $\omega \in \Nat$
    such that for all $p \in \Nat$,
    for all $\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_p \in \Sigma^*$,
    for all $u_1, \dots, u_p \in \Sigma^*$,
    there exists a polynomial $P \in \Rel[X_1, \dots, X_p]$
    whose \kl{maximal monomials} are \kl{non-negative},
    and such that for all $X_1, \dots, X_p \geq \omega$:
    \begin{equation*}
        f\left(
            \alpha_0 \prod_{i = 1}^p u_i^{\omega X_i} \alpha_i
        \right)
        = P(X_1, \dots, X_p) \quad .
    \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}


\begin{corollary}
    \label{n-rat-correct:lem}
    Let $P \in \Rel[X_1, \dots, X_p]$ be \kl{represented}
    by a \kl{$\Nat$-rational series}. Then,
    $P \in \CorrectPoly$.
\end{corollary}

\AP The core of the upcoming \cref{lem:correct-to-n-rat} leverages a notion of
\intro{discrete derivative} to perform an induction on the \kl{maximal monomials}.
This notion of derivation is built by translating the domain of the polynomial.
To that end, let us write $\intro*\translate{K}$ for the \intro{translation function}
that maps a polynomial $P \in \Rel[X_1, \dots, X_n]$ to the polynomial $P(X_1 +
K, \dots, X_n + K)$.

\begin{definition}
    \label{discrete-derivative:def}
    Let $\vec{X}$ be a tuple of indeterminates,
    $K \in \Nat$,
    and 
    $P \in \Rel[\vec{X}]$ be a polynomial.
    \begin{equation*}
        \intro*\Diff{K}{P} \defined 
        \translate{K}(P) - P
        \quad .
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

As one would expect, the \kl{discrete derivatives} are linear operations on
polynomials, that commutes with \kl{translation operators}. However, the
\kl{translation operators} do not perfectly commute with partial applications
$\restr{\cdot}{\nu}$.

\begin{remark}
    \label{discrete-deriv-linear:fact}
    For all tuples $\vec{X}$ of indeterminates,
    for all $K \in \Nat$, $L \in \Rel$, for all partial functions
    $\nu \colon \vec{X} \topartial \Nat$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The maps $\translate{K} \colon \Rel[\vec{X}] \to \Rel[\vec{X}]$,
        $\Diff{K}{ \cdot } \colon \Rel[\vec{X}] \to \Rel[\vec{X}]$,
        and
        $\restr{\cdot}{\nu} \colon \Rel[\vec{X}] \to \Rel[\vec{X}]$
            are linear operators,
        \item $\Diff{K}{ \cdot } \circ \translate{L}
            = \translate{L} \circ \Diff{K}{\cdot}$,
        \item $\restr{\cdot}{\nu} \circ \translate{L}
            = \translate{L} \circ \restr{\cdot}{\translate{L}(\nu)}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

In the actual statement of \cref{corrected-version:thm}, the representation of
polynomials in $\CorrectPoly$ is strengthened from \kl{$\Nat$-polyregular
functions} to \kl{star-free $\Nat$-polyregular functions}. This is not
surprising, given the conjecture that \kl{ultimately polynomial}
\kl{$\Nat$-polyregular functions} (the formal definition will be given in
\cref{star-free:sec}) were conjectured to be star free
(\cref{zsf-nsf:conjecture}), and that polynomials are always \kl{ultimately
polynomial}.

\AP When multiple indeterminates are involved, the notion of degree must be
adapted, and to ensure that the decision procedure is effective, one must
obtain explicit bounds on the \kl{translations} that are needed. To that end,
let us now introduce the ordering over which the induction of
\cref{lem:correct-to-n-rat} is built. Recall that $\MaximalMonomials(P)$ is the
set of \kl{maximal monomials} of $P$, hence belongs to $\Pfin(\Monomials)$. We
order \kl{monomials} with the \kl{divisibility ordering}, making $\Monomials$ a
\kl{well-quasi-ordering} that is isomorphic to $\Nat^k$ with the product
ordering \cite[Dicksonâ€™s Lemma]{SCSC12}. We endow $\Pfin(\Monomials)$ with the
\intro{Hoare ordering}, that is, $S_1 \hoareleq S_2$ whenever for all
\kl{monomials} $M_1 \in S_1$, there exists a monomial $M_2 \in S_2$, such that
$M_1$ \kl{divides} $M_2$. The set $(\Pfin(\Monomials), \hoareleq)$ remains a
\kl{well-quasi-ordering}, and is in particular well-founded \cite[Hoare
quasi-ordering]{SCSC12}.


Let us now illustrate how the \kl{discrete differentiation} operator interacts
with \kl{maximal monomials} with respect to the \kl{Hoare ordering}: it
extracts \emph{sub-maximal} monomials from a given polynomial.

\begin{fact}
    \label{derivation-monomials:fact}
    Let $K > 0$,
    and let $M,T$ be two \kl{monomials}, such that
    $T$ \kl{strictly divides} $M$.
    Then,
    every \kl{monomial} of $\Diff{K}{M}$ \kl{strictly divides} $M$,
    and 
    $T$ \kl{divides} some \kl{maximal monomial}
    of $\Diff{K}{M}$, which has a coefficient
    that is a multiple of $K$.
\end{fact}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{derivation-simplifies:lemma}
    For all $P \in \Rel[\vec{X}]$ that are non-constant,
    for all $K \in \Nat$,
    $\MaximalMonomials(\Diff{K}{P}) \hoarele
    \MaximalMonomials(P)$.
\end{lemma}

The following \cref{derivation-stabilises-correct:lem} is the main
combinatorial argument of this section. It leverages the positivity of the
\kl{maximal monomials} to compute a shift large enough to make lower degree
coefficients positive. This lemma will be lifted to a given polynomial $P$ by
noticing that if $K \in \Nat$, and $P = P_1 + P_2$, then $\translate{K}(P) =
P_1 + \Diff{K}{P_1} + \translate{K}(P_2)$.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{derivation-stabilises-correct:lem}
    Let $P \in \CorrectPoly$,
    $P_1$ be the sum of \kl{maximal monomials} of $P$,
    and $P_2 \defined P - P_1$ be the sum of
    non-maximal monomials of $P$.
    There exists a computable $K$,
    such that
    $Q \defined (\Diff{K}{P_1} + \translate{K}(P_2)) \in \CorrectPoly$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:correct-to-n-rat}
    Let $\vec{X}$ be a tuple of indeterminates,
    and let $P \in \Rel[\vec{X}]$.
    If $P \in \CorrectPoly$, then $P$ is \kl{represented}
    by a \kl{star-free $\Nat$-polyregular function},
    which can be explicitly constructed from $P$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We prove the result by induction on $\MaximalMonomials(P)$. 
    In the proof, we write $\vec{X}$ for the indeterminates appearing in $P$,
    that is, we assume without loss of generality that all indeterminates are used.

    \textbf{Base case:} If the (unique) \kl{maximal monomial} of $P$ is a
    constant term. Since $P \in \CorrectPoly$, $P = n \in \Nat$, and therefore
    $P$ is \kl{represented} by a constant \kl{star-free $\Nat$-polyregular
    function}.

    \textbf{Induction:} Assume that $P$ is not a constant polynomial, and let
    us write $P = P_1 + P_2$ where $P_1$ is the sum of the \kl{maximal
    monomials} of $P$. We compute a bound $K$ such that $Q \defined
    (\Diff{K}{P_1} + \translate{K}(P_2)) \in \CorrectPoly$ using
    \cref{derivation-stabilises-correct:lem}. Thanks to
    \cref{derivation-simplifies:lemma}, we also know that $\MaximalMonomials(Q)
    \hoarele \MaximalMonomials(P)$. By induction hypothesis, $Q$ is
    \kl{represented} by a \kl{star-free $\Nat$-polyregular function} which is
    effectively computable.

    Let us now remark that $P_1 \in \Nat[\vec{X}]$, and is therefore
    (effectively) \kl{represented} by a \kl{star-free $\Nat$-polyregular
    function} (\cref{n-poly-n-poly:example}). As a consequence,
    $\translate{K}(P) = P_1 + Q$ is (effectively) \kl{represented} by a
    function $f_\Delta$.

    For all partial valuations $\nu \colon \vec{X} \topartial \set{0, \dots,
    K}$ fixing at least one indeterminate,  we know that
    $\MaximalMonomials(\restr{P}{\nu}) \hoarele \MaximalMonomials{P}$. Because
    $\restr{P}{\nu} \in \CorrectPoly$, one can use the induction hypothesis to
    compute a \kl{star-free $\Nat$-polyregular function} $f_\nu$ that
    \kl{represents} $\restr{P}{\nu}$.


    Let us assume that the alphabet over which the (\kl{commutative}) functions
    $f_\Delta$ and $f_\nu$ are defined is $\set{a_1, \dots, a_n}$, with $a_i$
    representing the indeterminate $X_i$ of the polynomials. Now, let us define
    by case analysis the following \kl{commutative} \kl{star-free
    $\Nat$-polyregular function}, defined on words $w$ of the form $w \defined
    a_1^{X_1} \cdots a_n^{X_n}$, with $X_1, \dots, X_n \geq 0$.

    \begin{equation*}
        f(w) \defined
        \begin{cases}
            f_\nu(w) & \text{ if } \exists i \in \set{1, \dots, n}, X_i \leq K \\
            f_\Delta(a_1^{X_1 - K} \cdots a_n^{X_n - K}) & \text{ otherwise }
        \end{cases}
        \quad .
    \end{equation*}
    It is clear that
    $f$ is a \kl{commutative} \kl{star-free $\Nat$-polyregular function},
    and that
    $f$ \kl{represents} $P$.
\end{proof}


While \cref{lem:correct-to-n-rat} provides effective conversion, it does not
explicitly state that the membership is decidable to keep the proof clearer. A
similar proof scheme can be followed to conclude that membership is decidable,
and even show that elements in $\CorrectPoly$ are, up to suitable translations,
polynomials in $\Nat[\vec{X}]$. Beware that partial applications are still
needed in this characterization, as \cref{bad-poly-translate:ex} illustrates.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{derivation-translation:lem}
    Let $P \in \Rel[\vec{X}]$, 
    there exists a computable $K \in \Nat$
    such that the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{d-t-correct:item} $P \in \CorrectPoly$,
        \item \label{d-t-transl:item}
            for 
            all partial functions $\nu \colon \vec{X} \topartial \Nat$,
            $\translate{K}(\restr{P}{\nu}) \in \Nat[\vec{X}]$,
        \item \label{d-t-transl-fin:item}
            for all partial functions
            $\nu \colon \vec{X} \topartial \set{0, \dots, K}$,
            $\translate{K}(\restr{P}{\nu}) \in \Nat[\vec{X}]$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Furthermore, the membership is decidable.
\end{lemma}


\begin{example}
    \label{bad-poly-translate:ex}
    The polynomial $\BadPoly$ is not a 
    \kl{$\Nat$-rational polynomial},
    but is \kl{non-negative} and satisfies
    $\translate{10}(\BadPoly) \in \Nat[\vec{X}]$.
\end{example}

We are now ready to state the corrected and generalized version of
\cref{karh:thm}, which is the main technical contribution of the paper.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{corrected-version:thm}
    Let $P \in \Rel[\vec{X}]$ be a polynomial.
    The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{corrected-1:item} $P \in \CorrectPoly$,
        \item \label{corrected-2:item} $P$ is \kl{represented} by a \kl{$\Nat$-rational series},
        \item \label{corrected-3:item} $P$ is \kl{represented} by a \kl{$\Nat$-polyregular function},
        \item \label{corrected-4:item} $P$ is \kl{represented} by a \kl{star-free $\Nat$-polyregular function},
    \end{enumerate}
    Furthermore, the membership is decidable, and effective conversion
    procedures exist between all the representations.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The implications 
    \cref{corrected-4:item} $\implies$
    \cref{corrected-3:item} $\implies$
    \cref{corrected-2:item} are obvious.
    \cref{lem:correct-to-n-rat} proves
    \cref{corrected-1:item} $\implies$ \cref{corrected-4:item},
    while \cref{n-rat-correct:lem}
    proves 
    \cref{corrected-2:item} $\implies$ \cref{corrected-1:item}.
    Note that the lemmas provide effective conversion procedures,
    and that \cref{lem:correct-to-n-rat} also provides a decision
    procedure.
\end{proof}

Let us now state, for the sake of completeness, the equality of $\CorrectPoly$
and $\CoveredPoly$ in the case of two indeterminates. This is relevant because
it shows that examples given in \cite{KARH77} are actually correct, even though
based on an invalid result, and it may be the case for other works based on
\cite{KARH77}.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:correct-covered-2}
    $\CorrectPoly[X,Y] = \CoveredPoly[X,Y]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    It is clear that $\CorrectPoly[X,Y] \subseteq \CoveredPoly[X,Y]$,
    by considering the empty valuation $\nu \colon \set{X,Y} \topartial \Nat$.
    For the converse inclusion, let us consider $P(X,Y)$
    that is \kl{non-negative}, such that the \kl{maximal monomials}
    are  \kl{non-negative}.
   

    If we fix none of the variables, then the \kl{maximal monomials}
    are \kl{non-negative} by assumption. If we fix one of the
    variables, we can assume without loss of generality that we 
    fix $X = k$ for some $k \in \Nat$.
    Then $P(k,Y)$ is a \kl{non-negative} \emph{univariate} polynomial, 
    and therefore must have a positive leading coefficient
    (which is the unique \kl{maximal monomial} in this case)
    or be constant equal to 0. In both cases, the \kl{maximal monomials}
    have positive coefficient.
    The same reasoning applies \emph{a fortiori} in the case where
    we fix the two indeterminates, leading to a constant polynomial.
\end{proof}
