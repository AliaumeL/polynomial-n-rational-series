  This paper studies which functions computed by $\Rel$-weighted automata can be
  realised by $\Nat$-weighted automata, under two extra assumptions:
  commutativity (the order of letters in the input does not matter) and
  polynomial growth (the output of the function is bounded by a polynomial in the
  size of the input). We
  leverage this effective characterization to decide whether a function computed
  by a commutative $\Nat$-weighted automaton of polynomial growth is star-free, a
  notion borrowed from the theory of regular languages that has been the subject
  of many investigations in the context of string-to-string functions
