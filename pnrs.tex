\section{TODOs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use $\Nat$-polyregular functions all the time, and just 
        in the introduction talk about $\Nat$-rational series.
    \item Prove that $\Nat$-rational series of polynomial 
        growth are $\Nat$-polyregular functions, maybe using
        the results about ambiguity in automata?
        Theorem 5.22
    \item Define commutativity by a map 
        $\commute \colon \Sigma^* \topartial \Nat^{\Sigma}$.
    \item Define "commutative functions" and its symbol.
    \item Define "computed by" (like, recognised by) for commutative 
        functions.
    \item Change \cref{corrected-version:thm} to use directly
        star-free!
    \item Clear up the computability problems.
    \item Polynomial + Npolyregular => star free?
    \item Polynomial + N rational => N polyregular?
    \item cite the paper of Quantitative Monadic Second-Order Logic
        about why it is interesting class.
    \item Example of polyregular functions
    \item Example of non-polyregular functions
    \item Expand a bit on the notion of "derivative"
        and divisibility of monomials.
    \item What about matrices ? They are not minimisable... so we do not know
        about their eigenvalues ?
    \item What about the residual transducer ?
    \item What about weigthed automata? Does it mean something?
        -> we have unary input, so the automata really is an automata.
        -> we output numbers in $\Nat$
        -> residuals are what? totally ordered?
        -> recursive calls?
        -> if the function computes polynomials in $\Nat$, we can build
        the usual thing? and then we add "a few steps before"?

    \item Is the proof simpler by assuming
        $P(X + K) \in \Nat[X]$? This is way better.
    
    \item Prove decidability of the property.

    \item Show the equivalence with binomial

    \item What about
