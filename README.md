## Idiosyncrasies

### Theorems

The users must use the environment `therm` instead of `theorem`,
otherwise the theorems are not numbered. The theorem counter
is also named `therm`. 

### No Acknowledgements

It does not seem that the style allows for
acknowledgements on the first page of the paper.

### Citations

The package requires to use [natbib][]
to handle bibliography, which makes it differ from
the other branches of this repository.

[natbib]: https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib
