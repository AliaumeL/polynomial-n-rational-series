This paper addresses two questions regarding $\Nat$-polyregular functions, that
forms a proper subset of $\Nat$-rational series. We show that given a $\Rel$-rational
series, it is decidable whether it is computable via a commutative
$\Nat$-polyregular function, and provide a counter-example to the theorem of
Karhumäki that studied the same question in the case of polynomials. We also
prove that it is decidable whether a commutative $\Nat$-polyregular function is
star-free, by proving the stronger statement that star-free $\Rel$-polyregular
functions that are $\Nat$-polyregular are in fact computable using a star-free
$\Nat$-polyregular function. Building towards answering the same questions in the
non-commutative case, we present a canonical model of computation of
$\Nat$-polyregular functions by generalizing the notion of residual transducers
previously introduced in $\Rel$-polyregular functions.
