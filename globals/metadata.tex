        This paper answers two questions about 
        commutative unary output polyregular functions, called
        $\Nat$-polyregular functions, that forms a proper subset
        of $\Nat$-rational series.
        We show that given a $\Rel$-rational series,
        it is decidable whether it is computable via a commutative
        $\Nat$-polyregular function, and provide a counter-example
        to the theorem of Karhumäki that studied the same question
        in the case of polynomials.

        We also prove that it is decidable whether a commutative $\Nat$-polyregular
        function is star-free, by proving the stronger statement
        that star-free $\Rel$-polyregular functions that are
        $\Nat$-polyregular are computable using a star-free $\Nat$-polyregular function.
        This answers positively to previous conjectures on $\Nat$-polyregular functions,
        and the study of the commutative case seems to be useful
        towards a proof in the non-commutative case.
