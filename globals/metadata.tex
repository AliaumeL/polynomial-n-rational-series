        Deciding whether a $\Rel$-rational series
        can be computed as a $\Nat$-rational series
        is an open problem that was solved by Karhumäki in the
        specific case of $\Rel$-rational series that are commutative
        and compute a polynomial.
        We propose a short counter-example to this
        previous result on commutative $\Nat$-rational series,
        and prove a corrected version of the theorem,
        working of tdd
        We then discuss how the syntactic criterion could
        pave the way towards a decision procedure when the commutativity
        of the $\Rel$-rational series
        is not assumed.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Deciding $\Nat$ inside $\Rel$.
            \item Counter example.
            \item Characterization of $\Nat$-polyregular.
            \item Characterization of star free $\Nat$-polyregular.
        \end{itemize}
