    \begin{abstract}
        Deciding whether a $\Rel$-rational series
        can be computed as a $\Nat$-rational series
        is an open problem that was solved by Karhumäki in the
        specific case of $\Rel$-rational series that are commutative
        and compute a polynomial.
        We propose a short counter-example to this
        previous result on commutative $\Nat$-rational series,
        and prove a corrected version of the theorem, that only
        requires commutativity and a polynomial growth rate.
        We then discuss how the syntactic criterion could
        pave the way towards a decision procedure when the commutativity
        of the $\Rel$-rational series
        is not assumed.
