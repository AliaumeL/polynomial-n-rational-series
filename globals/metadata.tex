    \begin{abstract}
        We propose a short counter-example to a
        previous result on commutative $\Nat$-rational series
        by Karhumäki, and provide a proof for
        the corrected statement.
        This opens the way to the decidability of
        $\Nat$ polyregular functions 
        among $\Rel$ porylegular functions, which is
        an ongoing research.
