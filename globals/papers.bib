abstract="Call a string-to-string function regular if it can be realised by one of the following equivalent models: mso transductions, two-way deterministic automata with output, and streaming transducers with registers. This paper proposes to treat origin information as part of the semantics of a regular string-to-string function. With such semantics, the model admits a machine-independent characterisation, Angluin-style learning in polynomial time, as well as effective characterisations of natural subclasses such as one-way transducers or first-order definable transducers.",

The first step here is to extend Kruskal theorem from orders to binary relations so that the duality applies. Then, we describe the theorem obtained by duality and show that it corresponds to a theorem by Ferreira and Zantema which subsumes Dershowitz's seminal results on recursive path orderings.",
